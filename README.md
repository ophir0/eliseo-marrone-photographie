This is the repository for the creation of the Eliseo Marrone Photography website.

The barebones will be created with Vite using Javascript and the React framework.

The Gallery will be built with Yet Another React Lightbox, and will be hard-coded as there is no server-side coding happening at the moment: https://yet-another-react-lightbox.com/

Development branch is visible live at: https://development--eliseomarrone.netlify.app/

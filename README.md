This is the repository of the photography website for Belgian photographer, Eliseo Marrone.

This was made by using Vite, JavaScript, and ReactJS. I pulled in Bootstrap 5 is used to help with responsive web design accross desktop/mobile browsers.

React-Router-DOM is implemented to neatly change between components. 

The Gallery is built with Yet Another React Lightbox, and is hard-coded as there is no server-side coding happening at the moment: https://yet-another-react-lightbox.com/

Google Analytics is embedded and sends reports every week. 

A big to-do is to implement ReCaptcha into the contact form, but as this release was to coincide with an exhibition, this functionality had to be bypassed to provide a MVP. There are also some aesthetic tweaks here and there, but overall it serves it's base purpose. 

Netlify is pointing at this repo, and runs a production branch available at:
